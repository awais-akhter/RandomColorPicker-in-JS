## Description

This project provides a user-friendly interface to generate random colors using JavaScript. It consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file.

The `script.js` file contains a `changeColor()` function that generates a random RGB color value and sets it as the background color of the `<body>` element. The `style.css` file is responsible for styling the button and the page layout.

## Usage

To use the Random Color Picker:

1. Open the [live demo](https://calnum.000webhostapp.com/Random%20ColorPicker/index.html) in your web browser.
2. Click the "CLICK ME" button to generate a random color.
